We need to develop a system that allows automation of assignment of grounds to outdoor games. Automation of 
ground records provides feasibility in many ways for event organizers, with respect to choice of appropriate dates, 
cities etc.
Prepare a database of grounds, where each ground record contains the following information.
a. Ground name
b. City
c. State 
d. Names of the games it can hold
e. Dates and times available for each game 
f. Hourly rate for the ground for a specific game
g. Date and sport name

#Well, this is my Data Structures project of Sem 3 @ NIT Nagpur 
Implemented using Structures, Pointers, Arrays and Functions.
Data has been sorted using merge sort so as to minimize the time complexity
